<p class="mb-0">To build the first income stream today, we'll use Gumroad and Paypal:</p>
* [gumroad.com](https://gumroad.com){:target="_blank"}
* [paypal.com](https://paypal.com){:target="_blank"}

Note that for this guide, I assume that you already have a PayPal account and that you can send and receive payments to it. In other words, you should have PayPal set up before you start with this guide.

<h3 class="start-here">Step 1: Open an Account With Gumroad</h3>

Navigate to [gumroad.com](https://gumroad.com){:target="_blank"} and click the green "Start Selling" button. 

A popup will appear, with a sign up form on the right side.

![Gumroad Signup Page](/img/2017/09/02/001-sign-up-for-gumroad.png){:class="img-fluid shadow"}

Complete the sign up by adding your email and password. After pressing the "Create Account" button, you'll be taken to a page that looks like this:

![Gumroad Trial Page](/img/2017/09/02/002-gumroad-trial-page.png){:class="img-fluid shadow"}

Press the "No thanks" link for now.

After you press the "No thanks" link, a welcome to Gumroad message will open, with a form to fill out. 

<h3 class="start-here">Step 2: Fill Out the "What are you working on?" Form</h3>

The form to fill out has only three fields. Select the options as shown in the picture below, then press continue.

![Welcome to Gumroad Page](/img/2017/09/02/003-welcome-to-gumroad.png){:class="img-fluid shadow"}

<h3 class="start-here">Step 3: Add Your First Product</h3>

Click the "Add a Product" button.

![Add Your Product](/img/2017/09/02/004-add-your-product.png){:class="img-fluid shadow"}

Click the "Digital Product" button.

![Choose Digital Product](/img/2017/09/02/005-choose-digital-product.png){:class="img-fluid shadow"}

At this point, you have two options for your ebook.

The first option is to "Start selling today" by clicking the button on the left (option number 1).

The second option is to "Pre-order" and start selling before a release date (option marked with number 2 in the image below).

![Add Your First Product](/img/2017/09/02/006-add-your-first-product.png){:class="img-fluid shadow"}

Since you are just about to build your first income stream, I assume that you don't yet have the ebook completed, so we'll click option number 2. This will open the "Add a pre-order" window.

![Choose Digital Product](/img/2017/09/02/007-add-a-preorder.png){:class="img-fluid shadow"}

Here, in the first field we'll add the title of our ebook.

Now's a good opportunity to think about your skills and experiences. What can you write about? Even if you do not have any "original ideas", you can cover a common topic, but give it your own twist.

<p class="mb-0">Some examples to get your creativity going:</p>
* 10 Mediterranean Recipes for Health and Well-Being (psst, it's written by an Italian)
* How to Build a Tree House for Under $100
* Keeping Turtles as Pets
* Knit Your Own Sweater
* Where's My Place in The New Economy?

<p class="mt-5">In the second field, you need to list your price. Feel free to set your product at any price, but I suggest you set it to zero for now.</p>

In my opinion, it's always the best to price your products at their true value, and since you still do not have the product, set it to zero.

Of course, this is only my own opinion. Maybe pricing your product-to-be-made at $50 would give you better incentive to actually write it. 

In the third form field, you need to pick the release date for your ebook. I've set it to a date that is a few days from now.

Now that you've filled out the three form fields on the "Add your first product" page, click the green button that reads "Next: Customize".

A new window will open, showing the product screen for the ebook I aptly named "My Ebook".

![My Ebook Screen](/img/2017/09/02/008-my-ebook-screen.png){:class="img-fluid shadow"}

Now we need to think about how to create our ebook.

<h3 class="start-here">Step 4: Create Our Ebook Cover</h3>

It's time to start working on our ebook. So where to start?

Like most people, I'm a fan of keeping things exciting when I work. So, how can we make this process of writing our first ebook more exciting? For one thing, we can start with the ebook cover.

Only a couple of years ago, this used to be a bit of a difficult thing to do, that would take a couple of days at least. The most viable way to have a decent ebook cover was to crowdsource its creation. Thus, you'd have to announce the need for an ebook cover design, then wade through the submittions by a bunch of freelancers. All of this takes time, and it costs (some) money.

Altough taking the crowdsource path is still fine, we've got a lot faster alternative today. And you can use it for free.

The platform I'm reffering to is Canva. So let's start at their [book covers page](https://www.canva.com/create/book-covers/){:target="_blank"}. 

The [book covers page](https://www.canva.com/create/book-covers/){:target="_blank"} gives us some basic info about what kinds of ebook covers we can make with Canva, as well as that the tool is free, or at least, comes with a free plan. 

![Canva Free Ebook Cover Maker](/img/2017/09/02/009-canva-free-ebook-cover-maker.png){:class="img-fluid shadow"}

When you're ready, click the "Start Designing Your Book Cover" button, which will take you to the signup page. Once you're there, click the "Sign up with Email" button.

![Canva Sign Up with Email](/img/2017/09/02/011-canva-sign-up-with-email.png){:class="img-fluid shadow"}

Now fill out the form that appears. Once you do, you'll be greeted with the "Signup Complete" message, with three options to choose from. Pick the "Personal" option.

![Canva Signup Complete](/img/2017/09/02/012-canva-signup-complete.png){:class="img-fluid shadow"}

Clicking the personal option will take you to the dashboard, with the "23 second guide to beautiful design". Click the "Show me how it's done" button.

![Canva Show Me How It's Done](/img/2017/09/02/013-show-me-how-it's-done.png){:class="img-fluid shadow"}

Watch the interactive intro. Personally, I'm amazed at how simple Canva is to use.

After the intro is complete, a dashboard will appear. Notice the "Create a design" heading at the very top of the page. Under the heading, there is a number of book cover designs. The first one of them is titled "Kindle cover".

![Design Kindle Cover](/img/2017/09/02/014-design-kindle-cover.png){:class="img-fluid shadow"}

Even though we are selling our ebook via gumroad, it's always good to plan ahead, so let't click the Kindle cover icon.

A new window will open, so now let's just do what we saw in the 23 second guide after signing up.

In my case, I typed "Getting Started" in the search field. Then I clicked the "Photos" filter under the search form field, and added the free photo I picked from the search results.

Finally, I added the fonts to the ebook cover page, together with my own copy.

To see exactly how I've done this, you can watch this 5-minute video:

<h3 class="start-here">Step 5: Create Our Ebook Structure and Add Content</h3>

In order to finish our ebook, we also need to have some content to add to it.

However, even before we add the content to our ebook, we need to have a proper structure in place. In other words, we need to have properly formatted Headings, Subheadings, and a Table of Contents.

This requires a bit of upfront work. Also, you'd need to have knowledge of some of the advanced concepts of formatting MS Word documents. There are other ways to do it, but using MS Word for this task has a great advantage: it comes with a shallow learning curve.

To get going faster, you can use **the free ebook template available from jobfreejourney.com**. An additional benefit of using the template is, you'll see a preview of an ebook that we made available via Gumroad. 

In effect, by clicking the **free ebook template link**, you'll see how it looks when such an ebook is added to a webpage. By the end of this post you'll add your own ebook to a web page so downloading the ebook template is a great preview of the things to come.

Once we have downloaded the ebook template, we can open it and change the contents to suit our needs. 

To make it easier to tweak the ebook template, I've made a short video of doing just that:

Alright, so I've used the content from this very blog post, repurposed it a bit to make it suitable for the ebook format, and now I've got a completed ebook product.

<h3 class="start-here">Step 6: Upload the Ebook to Gumroad</h3>

At this point, I am ready to upload the ebook to Gumroad.
